<h4>Welcome to the Documentation Webiste!</h4>

This webiste is dedicated to hosting the documentation for the Micro Breadboard Power Supply, an open source hardware project.

The website is being hosted on gh-pages, which means it is it's own branch of the MicroBBPS repository!
- View the [source files](https://github.com/stasiselectronics/MicroBBPS/tree/gh-pages) on github

The theme for the website is based off of the wonderful Jekyll theme "Minimal Mistakes" by [Michael Rose](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/)
