# MicroBBPS
<h3> Integrated Micro Breadboard Power Supply</h3>
  
Here is the repository for the integrated version of the MicroBBPS. This design shares the same schematic and the same component placement as the solderless version. 

What makes this design special is that it has 26 rows of breadboard spaced plated through holes. This means you can take your breadboard experiments and directly transfer them to the integrated MicroBBPS to build a robust prototype that has easy power entry.

If you want to learn more about this particular version, be sure to check out the documentation webiste.
